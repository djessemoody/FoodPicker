By Populating foodlist.txt with restaurants such as:

You can run FoodPicker.py in python 2.7 or 3 to select a restaurant. 

The selected restaurant will be added onto donefood.txt. When all restaurants are selected donefood.txt will repopulate the restaurant list with the places you have already chosen!
